Final version of the Model

1. Raf dimerization needed to be fully actif 
 C-Raf is only actif when it is homodimerized

2. Rates for RasGRF
Dr. Feig mentioned that Sos and RasGRF have similar affinity
So we use Sos affinit for Ras: a thenth of all rates and kept Km the same

3.Troubleshoot for Ca 
 _added different type of buffer such as pump, nxca, fixed buffer (CB)
 _20X lower rates for CB because it was too fast and slowing simulation. Plus lower rate do not affect our result
 _two type of calcium, internal and external Ca exchange through leak
 _add a pool of NgCam in order to have available Cam for RasGRF
 Increase Pump and Leak to have calcium come down within 2sec and match data (cormier et al 2001) 


4.Troubleshoot for cAMP
 _Production of cAMP to mimic AC production (only product  of cAMP, no reactant)
 _PDE2 and PDE4, true buffers to maintain the basal level of cAMP
